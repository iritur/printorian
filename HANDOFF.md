# Handoff

Where the work stands, what is deliberately unfinished, and what needs a person.
Standing rules are in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md); this file is the part that changes.

**Update this before finishing a session.** A stale handoff is worse than none —
it is read as current, and this repository has already been bitten twice by
status documents that described built features as missing.

**As of:** 2026-08-22 · `main` at `70536c6` · 1108 backend tests, 206 frontend,
all six governance gates green.

The last two commits are documentation only: `docs/` lost three overlapping
design-kit documents and four stale statuses, and the agent rules split so a
session loads only its own half (`backend/CLAUDE.md`, `frontend/CLAUDE.md`).

## 1. What landed recently, and why it matters

Four changes in close succession, each of which alters something a person will
notice. Read this section before touching the fleet, the dashboard or the
stylesheets.

**Telemetry is summarised, and retention is on.** `metric_rollups` holds one row
per printer per hour. `telemetry_retention_days` ships at 90 for the first time —
it had been 0 since the table existed, because dropping raw samples with nothing
summarising them destroys the only copy.

> The safety property is a **clamp**, not an ordering. The drop cutoff is
> `min(now − retention, watermark)`, where the watermark is the hour rollups have
> actually reached. A farm whose summarising stalls stops dropping raw samples
> with it, and one that has never summarised an hour drops nothing at all. If you
> touch `workers/maintenance.py` or `contexts/fleet/retention.py`, this is the
> invariant to preserve — it is the only irreversible path in the system.

**The dashboard's occupancy figures changed source, and some numbers moved.**
`run_hours` / `capacity_hours` / `idle_hours` and the 7 × 24 load map used to be
derived from `print_jobs` — booked time, not running time. A paused or errored
print counted as run time; a job row never closed counted from its start to `now`
for ever; machine time with no job behind it was invisible; idle was a residual
against the roster. They are now measured from `metric_rollups`, and the
job-derived versions were deleted rather than left alongside.

Two consequences are visible on purpose: the note reads «ИЗ N ИЗМЕРЕННЫХ» rather
than «ВОЗМОЖНЫХ», and an unmeasured window shows an em dash where it used to show
`0.0`. On the load map, an hour nobody polled is **hatched** — distinct from both
bright and the outlined zero that means "measured, and idle".

**`GET /fleet/metrics` and `/fleet/metrics/{printer_id}` serve it.** Seconds only;
money and energy stay behind `VIEW_FINANCIALS`. Deliberately two routes with
different shapes, under their own prefix — `/printers/metrics` would collide with
`/printers/{printer_id}` by declaration order.

**The legacy `--pr-*` design tokens are gone**, along with 119 dead CSS rules.
Reachability was decided against the built bundle, not the source. One real bug
fell out: `.prep__done` asked for an undefined token, so its hard-coded fallback
always won — a light-palette green on a near-black panel at ~2.2:1.

## 2. Deliberately unfinished

Not oversights. Changing any of them is a decision, not a cleanup.

| | Why it is like that |
|---|---|
| `customer_storage_quota_bytes` displayed, not enforced | Refusing a quote mid-configuration is the wrong UX. Growth is bounded by `model_retention_days` instead. |
| Rate limiting and sign-in lockout are in-process | Correct for one API process (ADR-0003). Counters reset on restart; a second replica would get its own allowance. `docs/DATABASE-REVIEW.md` §9. |
| No `/metrics` endpoint | Stage 5. `/health/workers` gives the honest liveness signal meanwhile — it reads beats each worker loop records at the *end* of a pass, so it distinguishes wedged from working. |
| Off-site backup sync has a recipe, no committed job | Needs farm-specific credentials. |
| Storefront `body` lifts the page ground | Predates Harvester; `--hv-bg` vs `--hv-void` is six values out of 255 in dark, identical in light. A visual call, not a cleanup. See `apps/web/src/app.css`. |
| TypeScript held at 5.x | `openapi-typescript` crashes on TS 7. Reason and three failed workarounds are in `.github/dependabot.yml`. |

## 3. What is actually next

Verified against the code, not read off a plan document.

**Five design-kit screens have no implementation at all** — all control-realm:

| Screen | Backend state |
|---|---|
| `settings.html` | Nothing. No `contexts/settings`; farm rates are code defaults in `pricing/rates.py`. ~15 sections, ~100 parameters — the largest single gap. |
| `purchasing.html` | Nothing. No `PurchaseOrder`, no `Supplier`. |
| `service.html` | Backend half exists (`ServiceOperation` is a real service card); no screen, no route. |
| `store.html` (warehouse) | Backend half exists (`MaterialLot` carries locations); no screen. |
| `logistics.html` | Only `carrier_code` on a parcel. No shipments, no tracking. |

Every public screen is built. Detail, and what each of the five would need from
the backend, is in [docs/DESIGN-KIT.md](docs/DESIGN-KIT.md).

**Still persisted or served with no consumer:** `GET /materials/{code}` (the
console reads the table and `/materials/lots`, never the per-code detail),
`EstimateVariance`, and `RateSnapshotRecord`.

**Still persisted with no endpoint:** `EstimateVariance` (drives `price_review`
and the desk's «Пересмотр цены» filter) and `RateSnapshotRecord`. `TelemetrySample`
was on that list and no longer is.

## 4. Needs a person, not an agent

- **Dev account passwords have drifted from the docs.** `DEVELOPMENT.md` lists
  `floor@printorian.example` / `shop-floor-pass-1`; the stored hash does not match.
  `boss@printorian.example` was reset to the documented `owner-pass-12345` and
  works. Also: `floor@` is `engineer` in the database, `operator` in the docs —
  a role is an authorization decision, so it was left alone.
- **The storefront ground colour** (§2) — keep the lift or take Harvester's void.
- **`ruff format --check` was failing on `main`** before this run, on a migration
  committed as raw alembic output. Fixed in passing; worth knowing the gate can
  drift without anyone noticing, because a red CI on `main` is easy to live with.

## 5. If you are picking up mid-flight

Two things this repository will not tell you and that cost an afternoon each:

1. **Check `git status` first.** Agent work has been interrupted mid-write more
   than once, leaving a tree that compiles, passes lint, and has no tests for the
   part that matters. All six gates passed on a change whose only irreversible
   path was untested.
2. **Do not trust an agent's report of its own verification.** Reproduce it. Two
   separate reports of "all gates green" were produced by runs where the gate had
   not been executed at all.
